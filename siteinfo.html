His name is Shadow star, and he has bright greenish-yellow skin and ears a purple nose and pink lips.</p>
<p> He lives in the tunnels underneath grand Central Terminal in New York City.</p>

<p> The environment sounds like a subway tunnel you can hear the distant sounds of hustle and bustle of people in the station above.  You can hear train horns.  And you can hear the organ being played by these creatures. </p> 

<p> Like his kin he is an introverted individual who wants to be left alone by the human world.  He is not mean or harmful if he invites you in but if he feels you present a threat, he will attack you by any means necessary.  This creature and his kin put a lot of work into building their world and like any beings want it respected. </p> 

<p> This creature can shift its facial parts by throwing its eyes ears mouth lips and ears around and bouncing them off the walls like a game of pong. They can also use this ability as a weapon if necessary. </p>
